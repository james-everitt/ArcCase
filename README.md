# Arc Case
This is a case for the DIY monome arc pcbs found here: https://github.com/TheSlowGrowth/MonomeArcClone

There was a great effort online to do a run of anodised aluminium panels and windows to look like the original Arc. I missed out on that run, so made modelled a case in Fusion 360 to be 3D printed. All standoffs are printed, so there are no visible screw holes on the outside of the case. The top is acrylic, ive found grey tint acrylic (colour code 512) works well with the LEDs and 3D printed light shaper. I reduced the thickness of the lightshaper to 2mm, to reduce the case thickness down to 24mm
